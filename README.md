- The Dependable Hope of Each New Day - Jesus Christ
- 
- Hebrews 6:19
- 19 - Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
- 
- Hebrews 11: 24-26
- 24 - By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
- 25 - Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
- 26 - Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 
- 
- Matthew 11:28-30
- 28 - Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
- 29 - Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
- 30 - For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
